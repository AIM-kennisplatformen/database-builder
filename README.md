# Database_builder

This repository contains the database builder for the knowledgeplatform project. 

## Getting started

This repository contains a library and an application part (Todo!). The environment for development can be install by:

1). Installing [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/)

2). Running `pixi shell -e development` in your commandline -> Which downloads, installs all dependencies (if not yet installed) and opens a shell which is setup for development. From there you can open your editor.

(2 ALT). The alternative is to run `pixi run -e development vscode` in your commandline, which opens a vscode window set-up for your environment..
